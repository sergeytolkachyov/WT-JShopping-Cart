MOD_WTJSHOPPINGCART_WHATS_NEW="<h3>v.1.0.3 What's new?</h3><h4>Changing links in module layouts</h4><p>In the module layouts (located in the <code>tmpl</code> folder), the links to checkout and shopping cart have been changed. The <code>view</code> parameter has been replaced with <code>controller</code>. I recommend making menu items for ordering and shopping cart and hiding them in the menu item settings.</p>"
